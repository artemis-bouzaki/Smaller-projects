# 🎓 Stanford Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of **smaller machine learning projects** completed as part of the **Stanford University Machine Learning Specialisation**. Each project demonstrates practical implementation of core ML concepts, including regression, classification, neural networks, and model evaluation.

## What You’ll Find Here
- Implementations of classic ML algorithms from scratch and using Python libraries.  
- **Regression projects:** Linear regression with single and multiple variables.  
- **Classification projects:** Logistic regression for binary and multiclass problems.  
- **Neural network projects:** Handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset) for both binary and multiclass classification.  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques applied to real datasets.  
- Model evaluation, tuning, and performance analysis.  
- Jupyter notebooks documenting the project workflow, code, and results.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Supervised Learning:** Linear regression, logistic regression, feedforward neural networks.  
- **Classification:** Binary and multiclass classification with evaluation metrics.  
- **Neural Networks:** Forward/backward propagation, gradient descent, and training with real datasets.  
- **Data Handling:** Cleaning, normalisation, and feature selection.  
- **Programming:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.  
- **Documentation & Reproducibility:** Well-structured notebooks explaining methodology, code, and results.

## Purpose
These projects are designed to **reinforce fundamental ML concepts** while providing **hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating models**. They also serve as a showcase of my ability to **implement end-to-end ML pipelines** and communicate results clearly.
