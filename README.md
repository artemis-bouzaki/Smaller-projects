# 🛠 Smaller Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of **smaller coding and machine learning projects** completed as part of personal learning and structured courses. Each project demonstrates practical skills in programming, APIs, and machine learning, and showcases my ability to implement **end-to-end solutions**.  

The repository is organised into two main subfolders:

## 📂 Subfolders

### 1. `CFG (code-first-girls)`
**Python and Apps course sponsored by Barclays**  
This project is a Python implementation of a **Top Trumps game using the Pokemon API**.  

**Project Highlights:**
- Players are randomly allocated a Pokemon and compare chosen stats to determine the winner.  
- Allows customization of the **number of rounds**.  
- Players can select a **stat** to compare each round.  
- Winner of each round is determined automatically by the **highest stat value**.  

**Extensions & Features:**
- **Additional Characteristics:** Added more attributes from the Pokemon API for richer gameplay.  
- **Multiple Rounds:** Supports multiple rounds for extended gameplay.  
- **Round Results Presentation:** Results presented in a **table format** after each round.  
- **Input Validation:** Ensures user inputs, like number of rounds or stat selection, are valid.  

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Python programming, loops, functions, and data structures  
- API integration and JSON handling  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Basic game logic and UX considerations

### 2. `ML`
**Stanford University Machine Learning Specialisation**  
Contains a series of **smaller machine learning projects** including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network-based handwritten digit recognition.  

**Project Highlights:**
- Implemented classic ML algorithms from scratch and with Python libraries.  
- Covered **regression** (linear regression with single/multiple variables).  
- Covered **classification** (binary & multiclass logistic regression).  
- Built **neural networks** for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation included.  

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Supervised learning and neural networks  
- Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering  
- Model evaluation, tuning, and result interpretation  
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- Jupyter notebook documentation for reproducibility
